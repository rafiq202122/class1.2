It's exciting to start and build a business from <br>scratch. It's even more empowering and motivating to watch it grow, flourish, and become profitable.</P>

But soon, you'll likely find yourself overwhelmed with to-do lists, <br>unfinished tasks, unmet deadlines, and botched sales. Before you know it, your head is spinning, <br>and you're drowning in work, not knowing where to start.</p>
    <p>They most likely found a virtual assistant to take a few things off their plates so they could <br>focus on running the business. What to know more?

    <h1>What Exactly Does a Virtual Assistant Do?</h1>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/resources/guides/business/what-is-a-virtual-assistant?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bm_ge-ww_an-assistant_d-2023-01-01">virtual assistant </a> , or VA, is an independent contractor or freelancer usually hired to assist <br>with daily administrative duties and other business services. They're ideal if you're running a <br>business solo, especially when the workload becomes overwhelming and time-consuming, taking away <br>opportunities for you to build and grow. A VA is sort of like a <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/personal-assistant?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bm_ge-ww_an-assistant_d-2023-01-01" > personal assistant</a>, but focuses <br>more on general company tasks.</p>
    <p>Virtual assistants work remotely, and responsibilities will vary depending on the skills they <br>offer and the needs of your business. Typically, VAs will assist with general tasks that do not <br>require high-level training or knowledge. Here are some of the most common:</p>
    <p>Data entry</p>
    <P>Scheduling appointments</P>
    <P>Managing email accounts</P>
    <p>Online research</p>
    <P>Social media management</P>
    <P>Creating presentations</P>
    <P>Bookkeeping</P>
    <P>File organization</P>
    <P>Customer service</P>
    <P>Lead generation</P>
    <P>Sometimes, virtual assistants are qualified for more specialized services like graphic design, web <br>development, and marketing. If you don't have the skills or time, you can find a virtual <br>assistant who can handle these necessary tasks. Remember that if you hire a VA for creative work, <br> you'll want to ensure they have the time to complete the more tedious tasks.</P>
